Stop by and have a chat.<\/p>\n<h2>The Early Days<\/h2>\n<p><strong><\/strong>I grew up in Bergen op Zoom. A mid-size town in the South of the Netherlands. In fourth grade, I got a birthday present that marked the years to come. It was a do-it-yourself electronics kit. A combination of resistors, capacitors and transistors each uniquely marked with intriguing labels. I would not give up until I knew what drove these things. Devouring a wide range of &#8220;how to&#8221; books gave me the confidence to take anything apart. I often gained a few spare components while putting them back together. Nothing in the house was safe from me. I had to see what was inside. Learn what made them work. I wanted to see how complicated things happen; build radios out of old tape recorders. I enjoyed fiddling with these machines.<\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/hdunant.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-434\" style=\"margin: 2px 10px;\"  title=\"\"  alt=\"hdunant\" src=\"\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/hdunant.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/hdunant.jpg 300w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/hdunant-250x133.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>High school did not pose a challenge, except the ones I found for myself. I got straight A&#8217;s in all abstract subjects and flunked up everything else. Those classes were a hurdle on my quest for the magic. The train to my holy grail moved at an everlasting paste. Along the way, I studied nursing and taught basic medic first aid. I got certified for change. Work with people instead of machines. No undo-keys or reset-buttons here. Real people, real feelings in a real world.<\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong>In my freshman years at Antonie Keldermans Tech, I experimented with radio transmitters. Then it was audio equipment. I made light dance to music, build an audio mixer and an echo machine. I worked all summer to raise the money for my first computer. The joystick and graphics held my attention for exactly one year. In school, I had learned how to skip the middle man and talk right to the machine. Like Microsoft does now-a-days. I extended its programming language and wrote my own assembler. I took the hood off to get to the bare metal. It wasn&#8217;t a bad little box at all. The simplicity of its design invited me to explore and build add-ons. My world was never the same after that.<\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/dj.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-436\" style=\"margin: 2px 10px;\" title=\"dj\" alt=\"dj\" src=\"\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/dj.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/dj.jpg 300w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/dj-250x133.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>My time at AK Tech had raised more questions than answers. I had to continue my crusade and enroll at the university. No longer could I get away with making my homework in class. They knew what made me go. Those bastards. I learned the theory behind coax cables and semiconductors &#8211; things I had used for so long without understanding their magic. A whole new world opened up to me, a world of transformations; control engineering; computer models; digital logic and silicon design.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><strong><\/strong>I picked up some higher programming languages in the evening. Programming came easy to me, although I had to work extremely hard to do it very well. I signed-up to small contracts. These self-imposed deadlines often conflicted with my study, introducing me to the world of midnight-programming. At school, I squeezed through security holes and excelled my teachers in most microprocessor related fields. Computers became an extension of my mind. Like a carpenter&#8217;s toolbox. Part of the scenery I grew up in.<\/p>\n<h2>Embedded System Design<\/h2>\n<p><strong> <\/strong><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/zolder.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-441\" style=\"margin: 2px 10px;\" title=\"zolder\" alt=\"zolder\" src=\"\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/zolder.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" srcset=\"https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/zolder.jpg 300w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/1996\/11\/zolder-250x133.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>After graduation, I took a few months off to explore the rest of the world. Other cultures and different natural environments were tempting though, but I had to get my hands on computers. Entering my professional childhood, I learned about operating systems internals and did some contract work.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>School prepared me for big projects, and I did not want to wind up as a transformer designer. I was heading for the action, opportunity, responsibility and visibility. <!--I did not want to sit in a  \tcorner and become an everyday Joe.--> I wanted to see what I was worth. I knew pretty much about hardware design already, so I wanted to excel in software design. Preferably embedded design. I remembered a lively place with a local atmosphere and a contagious can-do attitude. I called a friend there and got scheduled for interviews that very same day. Being hired on the spot, I signed up to do the impossible.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>I guess nobody considered it a possible project in the time frame, but I didn&#8217;t know that. To me, it seemed, well, challenging. It could be done. The whole project depended on me, my project leader had put his trust in me. He wouldn&#8217;t break it down into little pieces and make it dull. The world of parallel programming and real-time constrains locked me inside the machine. A feeling that usually lingered some days. I lived for that machine. I pursued pure technical excellence. Weariness has been a badge and part of the fun.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>Much to my and my environment&#8217;s surprise, I came up with an elegant design. An absolute necessity for a machine that only had small lights to support debugging. A typical science fiction computer system. No console i\/o, fancy symbolic debuggers or tracebacks. I had to wait an hour to compile and load the software onto the target machine. I thought twice about trail-and-error approaches that were so common those days.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/meotribe.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-421 alignright\" style=\"margin: 2px 10px;\" title=\"meotribe\" alt=\"meotribe\" src=\"\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/meotribe.jpg\" width=\"303\" height=\"135\" srcset=\"https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/meotribe.jpg 303w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/meotribe-250x111.jpg 250w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/meotribe-300x134.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px\" \/><\/a><strong> <\/strong>The hardware, compilers and device drivers were crucial to make this dream come true. Deadlines lay impossibly near at hand and almost everything fell down on me. We had to take the skin off; hook up scopes and logic analyzers and trace a flaw down to a design error in the hardware. The compilers had unlisted features that required work-a-rounds. Device drivers functioned so poorly, that I had to write my own. Maybe it&#8217;s masochism. It was so fascinating. I&#8217;d stay up all night and experience it. A compulsion to program. Tame that sixty-six processor beast.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>The ultimate goal was to build a machine that would run our reliability test. Day by day, it became apparent that my client relied heavily on this corporate machine. Pretty scary to think that my machine was going to decide on money transactions. I had written just about every line that&#8217;s come out of this project. I don&#8217;t think they hand exiting projects like this to rookies anywhere else.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>The moment my machine got out of the door, I approached my email box with caution. Those maintenance guys could write any minute now to issue a problem report. This system does a million transactions a day, each running though thousands of statements. Had I missed something in the logic design? Would there be a ticking bomb haunting me down? Much to my relief the system turned out to be remarkably reliable.<\/p>\n<h2>The Challenge of Complexity<\/h2>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>For my next project, I&#8217;d set out to build something larger than myself. Something way beyond what any one person can do. A leading-edge-of-technology kind of thing. It was going to be tough. Working with a bunch of cynics and egotists and it&#8217;d be hard to keep up with them. It did not scare me. I like the notion of insecurity and challenge, of finding the edges. I&#8217;m the kind of guy who likes to climb up mountains, paraglide or scuba dive. I need something to keep me from hibernating.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/fiesch.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-422 alignright\" style=\"margin: 2px 10px;\" title=\"fiesch\" alt=\"fiesch\" src=\"\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/fiesch.jpg\" width=\"306\" height=\"161\" srcset=\"https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/fiesch.jpg 306w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/fiesch-250x132.jpg 250w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/fiesch-300x158.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" \/><\/a><\/span><\/strong>The initial system design was a kludge, like a wheel build out of bricks, with wooden wedges in between them; such a thing might work, but no sane engineer would be proud to have designed it. I like to do things &#8220;right&#8221;. I competed over new ideas and got the go-ahead to come up with a new design and influence our client to switch to a blazing state-of-the-art platform.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>A network interface was part of the deal. I proposed a new open platform-independent standard. Experts were saying this could not be fast enough to keep up with their transport. I would be writing my own death warrant. Though, I did not accept the established limits and it paid off. My interface proved to be twice as fast as required while introducing a flexibility unknown before.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>I was put under high pressure. I like to do so for a while. I could work more or less as I pleased, providing an &#8220;escape valve&#8221;. That&#8217;s not altruism on my employer&#8217;s part. If anybody kept track of my hours, they&#8217;d have to pay me a hell of a lot more that they did. I worked from my home for a while; staying up all night; forgetting to do the groceries or eat dinner. Pieces of my life dribbled away. I like my job, it&#8217;s great, I enjoy it.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>A year later, I got grounded by disease. This time, I was not allowed to work on the project that was constantly chugging away in my mind &#8211; making an exhaustive query for my data bank. Why couldn&#8217;t I finish it? Was this place supposed to be the Jerusalem of telecommunications? Well, I guess the only good strategy is one that no one else understands. I surely did not understand it. I often seemed to be working this hard in spite of the management. I did not want to let our customer down. I have my savings account with them. I had to help keep them afloat for awhile.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>Deadlines had come and gone, slipping a week a week. When I returned to the laboratory, I was given a chance to manage others for a change. It gave me a lot of control over things, at the price of a lot of pressure. No time to sit on my ass and complain. Webs of voluntary and mutual responsibility hold this project together. People are reaching out in the dark, touching hands. I provide the environment where things happen, leading by example. A thrill.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/spuit11.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-423 alignright\" style=\"margin: 2px 10px;\" title=\"spuit11\" alt=\"spuit11\" src=\"\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/spuit11.jpg\" width=\"307\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/spuit11.jpg 307w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/spuit11-250x120.jpg 250w, https:\/\/coert.vonk.one\/wp-content\/uploads\/2009\/11\/spuit11-300x144.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px\" \/><\/a><strong> <\/strong>Starting work eary ensures me of several hour of getting things done. Not being pulled into meetings. Sometimes, the next time I look up, it&#8217;s evening, but I&#8217;ve done what you set out to do. I leave the building thinking: &#8220;This is life. Accomplishment. Challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>It always try to understand a problem thoroughly and the concepts straight before I put it to paper. Like when you have a hundred L-shaped blocks to build a building. You take all the pieces, put them together pull them apart, put them together. After a while, you&#8217;re like a kid on a jungle gym. There are all these constructs in your mind and you can swing from one to the other with ease. I&#8217;ve done this in short intervals for a short period each year. You narrow your field of vision to a small little world, trying to make it a vision of your own mind, and that&#8217;s the kick &#8211; getting control of something. There&#8217;s a big section where you come down off it, and sometimes I feel a little strange, wobbly and tired, and I want to say to my friends, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m back&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2>A Year is a Heck of a Long Time<\/h2>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>Things change fast in the field of information technology. A year is a hell of a long time. It&#8217;s like a year in a dog&#8217;s life. Sometimes I wonder what happens to computer engineers when they get old. Are they made into dog food, like pyramid architects in ancient times? Among engineers generally, the most common form of ambition &#8211; the one made most socially acceptable &#8211; has been the desire to become a manager. If you don&#8217;t become one by a certain age, then in the eyes of your peers you become a failure. Among computer engineers, I think, the wish to manager must be a virtual instinct. The industry&#8217;s short product cycles lend to many projects an atmosphere of crisis, so that computer engineering which is arduous enough in itself, often becomes intense. The hours are long. Emotions get taxed. Moreover, the technology of computers changes constantly; every year it&#8217;s a struggle to keep up. Keep a kind of &#8220;a long-term tiredness&#8221; from creeping over you.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <\/strong>I like to live at the level of design where physical and abstract meet. It is my own, or I make it my own. Not get bored. I need to be thrown a challenge once in a while. I don&#8217;t want to waste time listening to people who aren&#8217;t making good relevant sense, just in order to be polite. I don&#8217;t want to say &#8220;I&#8217;m a little confused here&#8221; when I really mean &#8220;you guys screwed up&#8221;. <em>I want to get things done.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Other Activities<\/h2>\n<p><strong><\/strong><strong> <\/strong>Computers are not what I do for recreation. Outside of work, I do other things, like scuba diving and hiking. Drop me a line, or swing by, if you want me to dump core on that. In general, I like to get away from it all. Preferably far-far away from telephone, fax, and even the internet. Yes, I do like exciting sports, but I don&#8217;t just like them from the thrill &#8230; as I think of it, I haven&#8217;t been out for quite a while lately &#8230; <em>see ya<\/em> &#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I grew up in Bergen op Zoom.
